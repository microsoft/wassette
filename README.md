Instantly discover and run MCP tools using natural languageâ€”all within secure, isolated WebAssembly sandboxes. Wassette replaces risky native tool execution with a controlled, sandboxed environment, letting you define exactly what each tool can accessâ€”without the hassle of manually configuring every MCP tool.

- ðŸ”§ **Dynamic Loading**: Load WebAssembly components on-demand from OCI registries, URLs, or local files - no restart required.
- ðŸ”’ **Secure Sandboxes**: Each tool runs in isolated WebAssembly environments with capability-based policies controlling file/network access.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Runtime Introspection**: Automatically discover tool capabilities and exported functions without manual configuration.
- ðŸ§© **Composable Tools**: Mix and match components from different sources in real-time - build workflows dynamically.
- ðŸš€ **Developer-Friendly**: Write functions that compile to WASM components, not entire servers - focus on logic, not infrastructure.
- âš¡ **Hot-Swap Tools**: Load, unload, and replace components without downtime - perfect for experimentation and development.

> ðŸ¦º This project is in early development and actively evolving. Expect rapid iteration, breaking changes, and responsiveness to feedback. Please submit issues or reach out with questions!

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/wassette/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will detect your platform and install the latest `wassette` binary to your `$PATH`.

## Setup Your Agent

Wassette works with any MCP-compatible agent. The setup is always the same: **add `wassette serve --stdio` as an MCP server**.

**ðŸ‘‰ [Complete setup guide for all agents (Visual Studio Code, Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/blob/main/docs/mcp-clients.md)**

**Example for Visual Studio Code:**

```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"Wassette","command":"wassette","args":["serve","--stdio"]}'
```

## Try It

Enter the following prompts into your AI client's chat:

1. **Load the time server component:**

   ```
   Please load the time component from oci://ghcr.io/yoshuawuyts/time:latest
   ```

   When prompted, confirm loading. This downloads the time server from the OCI registry and makes it available to Wassette.

2. **Query the current time:**

   ```
   What is the current time?
   ```

   This will prompt your MCP agent (e.g., GitHub Copilot in VS Code) to call Wassette, which uses the time component to return the current time.

   ```output
   The current time July 31, 2025 at 10:30 AM UTC
   ```

**Built-in Tools for Dynamic Loading:**

- `load-component` - Load WebAssembly components from any source
- `unload-component` - Remove components from the runtime
